Instruction: How to Use this Codes Backup File

This file is used when the code of existing content is damaged.
This file contains sections of codes that could be used to replace the old contents of the website.

When you need to do the replacement, please have a look at the content you want to replace in the original html file.
e.g. if you want to replace a 'small event' on the index page, please look at the code of index-events.html, and you will find the code section which needs to be replaced.
And you will also find that there are notes marking the start and end of every code section.
In the notes, you will find the noted name of the code section, which is called 'single event - small'

Then search 'single event - small' in this file, and you will find one or more code sections that you might need.

Have a look at the contents and select the code section that you need, then copy it to replace the old content.
When you copy and paste the codes, please copy together with the notes before and after the sections.
