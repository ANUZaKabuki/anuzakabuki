            In 2019 we were invited to the Cowra Festival of International Understanding, in rural NSW, supporting the
            guest nation of Japan. Japan and Cowra have a special historical connection, so it was surprising to explore
            the town and discover all of these connections. We gave two short performances, one in front of 300 local
            school students, and a second evening performance open to the general public. It was difficult to produce a
            performance to our quality standards as early in the year as March but we were glad to rise to the
            challenge.

            In celebration of our 40th year in 2017, we travelled to Melbourne for a performance tour. Stopping in
            Albury-Wodonga on the way to present a school visit, we performed 4 times in Melbourne at various locations,
            including in the company of the Japanese Consul-General. We were also featured on SBS Japanese Radio. This
            provided a fantastic opportunity for many of our international members to see different parts of Australia
            and allowed us to reach a wider audience than just Canberra. Additionally, we were able to socialise with
            the Melbourne University Japanese Club, further deepening the Australia-Japan and Canberra-Melbourne
            relationship.

            In September 2016, over 20 members of the ANU Za Kabuki Club left Canberra to embark on a two week trip to
            Japan. We travelled predominantly in the Tohoku region, parts of which were left devastated by the
            earthquake and tsunami of March, 2011.
            We performed three shows, first in Akita, then in Kesennuma and Ishinomaki. In each location, we met with
            locals, engaged in community activities and had the chance to educate ourselves about the disaster and its
            impact on the local towns and cities.
