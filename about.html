                    The Australian National University Za Kabuki Club is a student-run club which performs and studies
                    the traditional Japanese theatre style of kabuki.

                    We are mostly made up of students who are studying or have an interest in the Japanese language and

                <p class="paragraphs subpage-paragraphs">
                    We invite people of all skill levels - in both Japanese language and acting - to try out and

                    Our club was formed in 1976 by teachers in the ANU Japan Centre, including Mr Shun Ikeda, who still
                    plays a vital role in the club today. Starting out as a modern Japanese theatre group, the club’s
                    aim was always to both introduce some unfamiliar aspects of Japanese culture to students, and to
                    give students a medium through which they could practice and improve their Japanese outside of the
                    classroom.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphs subpage-paragraphs">
                    In 1999, the club had its first performances outside of Australia, visiting Japan and performing in
                    Kobe and Nara. In 2016, the club once again ventured overseas to do three performances in the Tohoku
                    region of Japan, including in areas heavily affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

                    Our style of kabuki is very different from traditional kabuki found in Japanese theatres. Our long
                    history has allowed us to develop our own unique style which includes cross-dressing, modern jokes,
                    dancing, pop music and many other uniquely Australian features.

                <p class="paragraphs subpage-paragraphs">
                    Although our performances contain many non-traditional aspects, we use traditional scripts, enabling
                    students to explore the old Japanese language and traverse into unfamiliar areas of their language
                    studies. We also make use of projection technology to provide English ‘subtitles’ so that the
                    audience can better understand the dialogue.

                    A typical year for a kabuki member is divided into two parts: reading the script during our reading
                    practice, 読み稽古 (yomi-geiko), and standing practice, 立稽古 (tachi-geiko). For our actors, the first
                    semester is all about learning to read the script, choosing which role they will play and starting
                    to memorise lines. For our backstage members, this is an important time to start building the props
                    and creating the backdrops that will be used during the performance.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraphs subpage-paragraphs">
                    The second half of the year is when we move to working through our actors’ movements and adding in
                    visual comedic elements. Our props are usually in the process of being finalised, just in time for
                    our performance, which is usually held in October.

                <p class="paragraphs subpage-paragraphs">
                    About one week out from the performance, everything starts coming together as we move into the venue
                    and set up our backdrops, test out our subtitles, sound, and lighting, and start doing full dress
                    and makeup rehearsals.

                <p class="paragraphs subpage-paragraphs">
                    But it’s not just all about performing! Our members also participate in many university, social and
                    cultural events throughout the year.
